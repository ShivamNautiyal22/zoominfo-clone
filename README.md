# zoominfo-clone
This is the clone of zoominfo original website made with the use of HTML , CSS and JavaScript 
<br>
this website is full responsive in all devices (mobiles, tablets, big screens, etc)

# original website link is : https://www.zoominfo.com/

This website looks same as this above link provided but the footer section has less content than original website because of my main focus on applying javaScript into the page. 
<br>
As this page has javascript code in which i only add the hamburger option for small devices and tablets and apart from this i also the add animation in number in middle of the page where i use Intersection Observer API for that animation.
